To repeat the simulation results, please follow the procedures listed below:
- Step 1: put all these R scripts in a folder
- Step 2: run R scripts (2)-(7) either simultaneously or separately, and then you will get a the raw simulation results.
- Step 3: run R scripts (8)-(9) to transfer the raw simulation results to readable tables.
